Can we talk about what teaching actually looks like? 

It's Sunday at 10pm and you're still planning.
It's 5am and someone texted "I'm sick, need sub plans."
It's staring at a parent email for 20 minutes not knowing where to start.
It's juggling 12 different apps that don't talk to each other.

We've been there. That's exactly why we built My Teachers Toolbox.

🧠 Lesson plans in 90 seconds (real ones, not generic AI garbage)
🚨 Emergency toolkit ready for every "oh no" moment
💬 Parent communication that practically writes itself
👥 Team collaboration that keeps everyone aligned
